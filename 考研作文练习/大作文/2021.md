As is vividly depicted in the drawing, a thought-provoking scene unfolds: a boy dressed in the Monkey King costume complains to his father that his classmates find learning opera boring. In response, his father encourages him, saying, "**That is all that matters**, as long as you yourself are fond of it."

Simple as the picture looks at first glance, upon closer reflection, it crystallizes a profound truth: only by turning a deaf ear to discouraging remarks can we stay true to our original aspirations（抱负，志向，渴望）. Indeed, living in a web of diverse social relationships, we **are easily swayed by** the opinions of others. However, we will never be able to take charge of our own destiny if we are overly concerned with external judgment. A good case in point is Wei Dongyi, a mathematical genius. Though once ridiculed by netizens for his appearance, he **paid no heed to** such noise and devoted himself to research, proving that true value lies in self-fulfillment rather than the validation（认同） of others.

In summary, enthusiasm acts as a spiritual pillar that helps us weather setbacks. Instead of giving in to pressure to follow the herd, we should demonstrate unwavering **adherence to** our true passions.
