As is vividly depicted in the drawing, a thought-provoking scene unfolds before a campus bulletin（n.公告） board. Upon seeing a lecture notice, one student dismisses it as "useless" citing its irrelevance to her major, whereas her peer holds the opposite view, deeming it "definitely beneficial."

Indisputably, the first girl's attitude reflects a prevalent trend of utilitarianism—a short-sighted mindset that prioritizes immediate gains over long-term growth. Amidst this fast-paced society, a myriad of individuals are becoming increasingly profit-oriented, falling prey to the obsession with extreme "efficiency". Furthermore, mass media often reinforces this pragmatic mindset, erroneously advocating that targeted endeavors, rather than comprehensive learning, serve as the bedrock of our survival. However, to achieve true well-being, it is imperative to discard this narrow utilitarian approach and cease measuring the value of everything solely by its utility.

In summary, embracing utilitarianism indiscriminately will not only reduce us to mere slaves of utility but also deprive us of the genuine joy of life. Equipped with intellect and distinct judgment, we can successfully steer clear of the pitfalls of such narrow-mindedness.
