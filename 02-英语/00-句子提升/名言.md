1. Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire.（己所不欲，勿施于人。）—— Confucius（孔子）
2. **The human essence** is no abstraction inherent in each single individual. **In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relation<u>s</u>.**  （人的本质不是单个人所固有的抽象物，在其现实性上，它是一切社会关系的总和）——  Karl Marx
	- Just as Karl Marx famously stated, **human essence is "the ensemble of the social relations."** This philosophically justifies why our surroundings and the people we associate with play a decisive role in shaping our character.
	- Regrettably, in the digital era, many people tend to isolate themselves in virtual worlds, forgetting the wisdom of Karl Marx that **human essence is, in reality, 'the ensemble of the social relations.'** By cutting off real-world interactions, we are essentially denying our own humanity. It is these tangible bonds—between family members, friends, and colleagues—that constitute who we are.（遗憾的是，在数字时代，许多人倾向于将自己隔离在虚拟世界中，忘记了马克思的智慧：人的本质实际上是“一切社会关系的总和”。切断现实世界的互动，本质上是在否定我们的人性。正是这些有形的纽带构成了我们是谁。）
