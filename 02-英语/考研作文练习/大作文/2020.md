What depicted in these drawings is a stark contrast: in the first picture, a girl is doing assignments, sparing no efforts to finish homework as early as possible, whereas in another picture, a boy delays his homework to dead line, sitting in a sofa. Below these drawings is a coption that reads, "habits". 
Simple as these pictures look like at first glance, but upon closer reflection, they crystallize a truth that habits serve as a pillar that underpins the success of every ambitious person. Indeed, a positive habit may enhance your chance on success only by 0.1%, yet it upgrades exponentially your skills ultimately. Not only can habits fortify and enrich us, but also be detrimental to us if they act as symbol of the languid. A compelling case is Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft. His adherence to daily exercise sparks his passion for work, leading to significant success in bussiness which proves that it is good habits that keep our momentum of life. 
Altogether, positive habits necessitate proactive measures to build up. Equipped with good habits, people will not only navigate around the pitfalls of laziness but also unlock their full potential.
